## Networking and Peer Discovery

### Connecting Two Peers

(hyperswarm/dht intro: createServer + connect with the DHT)

### Connecting to Many Peers

(hyperswarm intro: join and on('connect', ...)

## Sharing Data

### Simple Append-Only Logs

(add some data to a hypercore, replicate to a clone, watch for live changes)

### Key-Value Stores

(write key/value entries, replicate to a clone, read and watch for changes)

### Files and Directories

(write files directly, load a directory with mirror drive, replicate to a clone, read + watch for changes)

## Takeaways

(Keet is just a Hyperdrive, which is just a Hyperbee, which is just a Hypercore)
